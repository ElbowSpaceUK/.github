Before Submitting a PR make sure you have:

- [ ] Make sure you've added Tests to cover any changes to existing functionality,
- [ ] Run the test suite locally and everything has passed as expected (Make a note if you're submitting a WIP PR with what's broken and include the Error!),
- [ ] Run artisan insights and everything is within the Docs thresholds,

Make sure you have done the following once you've added your Pull Request:

- [ ] Written a brief overview of the functionality of your PR,
- [ ] Add a required by date to your PR if it's related to a deadline,
- [ ] Do a first check for obvious mistakes (Think typos) and resolve them!
- [ ] Assign a Reviewer to do a secondary Code review (Think about who might have the most experience for the PR, if in doubt ask!)
